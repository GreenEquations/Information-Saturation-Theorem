# üß† Information Saturation Theorem

## Overview

This theorem explores the phenomenon of **information saturation** in autonomous systems ‚Äî including AI models, decision-making algorithms, and symbolic processing frameworks ‚Äî where increased data input leads to **diminishing returns** and eventual performance degradation.

At a critical **information density threshold** (Œ∏·µ¢), systems begin to lose coherence, semantic stability, or processing efficiency. This affects both artificial intelligence and human cognition, particularly under recursive or high-complexity data conditions.

## üî¢ Key Concepts

- **Information Density Function D(t)**:  
  Models the efficiency of data processing as a function of time and semantic load.

- **Critical Information Threshold Œ∏·µ¢**:  
  Point at which further input yields degraded output quality.

- **Adaptive Filtering**:  
  Real-time prioritization of high-value, high-entropy data. Low-information or redundant inputs are discarded.

- **Self-Optimization Protocols**:  
  Feedback-driven adjustments to data intake and processing strategies.

- **Performance Metrics**:  
  BERTScore, logit entropy, embedding drift, mutual information, output consistency.

## üß™ Testable Predictions

### AI Systems
- Recursive input cycles will lead to semantic drift and feedback collapse.
- Measurable decline in performance as Œ∏·µ¢ is exceeded (e.g., drop in BERTScore).

### Human Cognition
- Information overload leads to delayed reasoning, inconsistent output.
- Physiological markers: increased EEG entropy, pupil dilation, slower response time.
