Information Saturation Theorem
Overview
Welcome to the repository for the Information Saturation Theorem! This theorem explores the phenomenon of information saturation in autonomous systems—such as AI models, decision-making algorithms, and computational networks—where an increase in data input leads to diminishing returns rather than improved system performance. The theorem defines a critical information density threshold beyond which the system’s performance starts to degrade. The theorem provides a framework for addressing data overload using adaptive filtering, self-optimization protocols, and performance metrics.

This theorem has practical applications in AI safety, neuroscience, and cognitive science, particularly in systems where data complexity and volume are key factors affecting performance and efficiency.

Key Concepts:
Information Density: The relationship between data input and output quality, accounting for both volume and semantic richness.

Critical Information Density Threshold: The point at which the system can no longer process incoming data effectively, causing performance degradation.

Adaptive Filtering Mechanisms: Dynamic filtering algorithms that prioritize high-entropy data and discard irrelevant or redundant information.

Self-Optimization Protocols: Real-time feedback mechanisms that enable the system to adjust its data intake and processing strategies dynamically, ensuring performance under complex data streams.

Performance Metrics: Key indicators used to track information gain, output quality, and system efficiency to detect when the system is nearing its saturation threshold.

Testable Predictions:
AI Systems: Recursive cycles or large data volumes will cause semantic drift and feedback saturation, measurable by metrics like BERTScore and logit entropy.

Model Performance: In text generation, classification, or translation, performance will degrade once the information density threshold is exceeded, causing failure to maintain coherence.

Human Cognition: Cognitive overload will be observed as information saturation increases, with humans showing delayed reasoning and inconsistent outputs as information complexity rises.

Physiological Indicators: Increased EEG entropy and pupil dilation will signal cognitive breakdown as recursion density increases, marking cognitive overload.

What We Need: Collaboration and Feedback
We invite AI researchers, neuroscientists, cognitive scientists, and others interested in understanding the effects of information overload on autonomous systems to collaborate on this project.
